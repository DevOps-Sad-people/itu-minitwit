# UI-Testing

## Selenium vs Playwright

**Selenium**

Architecture: 
1. Selenium use a language specific library (e.g C#, Python, Java, Ruby)
1. WebDriver API
1. Browser Drivers - these are executatbles that act as a middle layer between Selenium and the browser. 
   - Recieve HTTP requests from the Selenium client
   - Translate them into native browser commands (click, navigate, input)
1. Browser
   -  Receives commands from the driver.
   - Executes actions (e.g., loading a page, clicking a button).
   - Returns the result/status back through the driver to the client.

History:
Selenium was created in 2004 and is mature and battle-tested. It support a lot of programming languages. It is compatible with all major browsers. It has a huge community, ecosystem and integration. 


**Playwright**

Architecture: 
1. Playwright uses a language specific library (e.g C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby)
1. Playwright Driver. Unlike the Selenium, Unlike Selenium, no separate browser driver executables are needed.
1. Playwright uses a WebSocket connection rather than the WebDriver API and HTTP. 

Extra features:
- Playwright works natively with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari engine) out of the box
- Auto-waiting for elements prevents flaky tests, whereas Selenium often requires explicit waits
- The webSocket stays open for the duration of the test, so everything is sent on one connection. 

This is one reason why Playwrightâ€™s execution speeds tend to be faster.
Genreally Playwrigt is easier to setup and use develop tests.

History:  
Playwright is fairly new to the automation scene created in 2020. It is faster than Selenium and has capabilities that Selenium lacks, but it does not yet have as broad a range of support for browsers/languages or community support. It is open source and [backed by Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright).


We tried to implement both Selenium and Playwright. For us it was impossible to get the Selenium to work, we had critical problems with the external browser drivers needed for the Selenium framework to work. Playwright did not need external dirvers since built in protocol clients and was easy to setup and use to develop new UI test. 


## Playwright Testing

### How to run
How to run all test locally - this will find the test automatically

```bash
pytest
```

if you want to see the test you can run
```bash
pytest --browser chromium --headed --slowmo 200
```

if you want to only run ONE file

```bash
pytest Playwright/test_signup.py  --browser chrome --headed --slowmo 200
```
### Create a new test
1. Create a new file in the `Playwright` folder with the name `test_<new_test>.py`
1. The file should have functions to test the new functionality
1. The function take in the `Page` class from `playwright.sync_api` 
1. The function should have `page.goto("<url_of_page_to_test>")`
1. Then the rest of the function should test the functionality of the page
1. Read the next section to see how to record a test

# Simulator Tests

The simulator can be found in the folder `simulator/` and contains
- `minitwit_scenario.csv` (data)
- `minitwit_simulator_test.py` (sends request with the data)

The simulator test are run as a part of the testing pipeline/workflow [`test-on-request.yml`](../.github/workflows/test-on-request.yml) . It runs to ensure that the enpoints behave correctly, testing that the endpoints are available and return the correct status codes.
