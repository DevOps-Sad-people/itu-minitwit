# This action currently includes 3 different linter/formatter tools:
# - A standard Ruby linter and formatter
# - An ERB file linter
# - A Dockerfile linter

# "if !cancelled()" is added to all of the steps,
# so if a linter fails we still evaluate the other linters
# as well before failing the whole action
