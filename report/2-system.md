## [Nic] Important interactions of subsystems.
Both the simulator and client contact the same API application, so both sequence diagrams look identical. The following sequence diagram uses the simulator request endpoint `/fllws/[username]` as the baseline. The following sequence diagrams does not take Docker Swarm into account, as the underlying communication is hidden.

![UML Sequence diagram of monitoring and logging](./images/sim-request.jpg)

For monitoring and logging, we have also included a sequence diagram to show how they interact with each other.

## [G] Describe the current state of your systems, for example using results of static analysis and quality assessments.
At the current state of the project all major functionalities are implemented and out on production with only a few minor issues remaining, which are listed on the Github repository's Issues page [here](https://github.com/DevOps-Sad-people/itu-minitwit/issues). 
   
Throughout development we also used static analysis tools such as SonarQube and CodeClimate to ensure code quality. The quality assessment reported by SonarQube can be seen on the image below:   

![SonarQube report of the project](./images/analysis.png)
   
We managed to avoid/solve *Security* and *Reliablity* issues, and the remaining *Maintainability* issues mainly included "multiple string literals" problems, which we deemed non-crucial. Code duplication was also kept at minimal, coming in at 7.9% for the the entire codebase (*Note: source code provided by the course, such as the flag_tool or the simulator was excluded from the quality assessment*).


## [ALL] MSc students should argue for the choice of technologies and decisions for at least all cases for which we asked you to do so in the tasks at the end of each session.


### Programming language and framework
We considered several programming languages and frameworks for the API application, including C# with Razor-Pages, Ruby with Sinatra, and Go with Gorilla. More in Appendix. 


### Virtualization techniques and deployment targets

### CI/CD system

We have chosen Github actions they offers a free, scalable, and secure CI/CD solution with seamless GitHub integration, customizable YAML workflows, reusable actions, multi-platform support, and efficient automation through parallel execution and event-driven triggers.


### Database
We went with postgres. Both MySQL and postgres are great options for our purpose - familiarity with postgres and open-sourced tech ruled the choice. More in appendix. 

### Testing (Unit, UI, E2E)

**Selenium vs Playwright**

Playwright is a fast, open-source browser automation tool backed by Microsoft that launches browsers quickly, runs tests in parallel, and uses optimized headless mode for faster execution than Selenium. It supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit natively, auto-waits for elements to reduce flakiness, and uses a persistent WebSocket connection instead of Seleniumâ€™s HTTP-based WebDriver. We tried to implement both Selenium and Playwright. For us it was impossible to get the Selenium to work, we had critical problems with the external browser drivers needed for the Selenium framework to work. Playwright did not need external dirvers since built in protocol clients and was easy to setup and use to develop new UI test. 

**Minitest vs Rspec**

We chose RSpec, as we're prioritizing readable and maintainable technologies. It is also a very popular and large toolkit, which is great for testing!


### Static Analysis + Linting

### Hosting (Digital Ocean)

**Digital Ocean vs AWS/Microsoft Azure**
They both offer rental of VMs. We chose Digital Ocean because of its simplicity and great tooling. Because of the simplicity we can focus on everything else, rather than learning how a complex tool works. Pros and cons found in Appendix. 

### Monitoring + Logging

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Vagrant for staging and Terraform for production. We chose Terraform for production because it is powerful and flexible, allowing us to manage our infrastructure as code across multiple droplets. Vagrant is used for staging because it provides a simpler setup, allowing us to quickly spin up and tear down instances as needed.


### old 

## Virtualization
- **Docker**
- **Vagrant**

## Change of database

We went with postgres. Both MySQL and postgres are great options for our purpose - familiarity with postgres and open-sourced tech ruled the choice.

## Monitoring
We chose **Prometheus** + **Grafana** for our monitoring stack.

**Prometheus** provides several features which are useful for us:
- centralized, pull-based metric collection
- metrics are time-series based -> can show changes over time
- had ane existing Ruby client library -> easy setup & integration with our system

**Grafana:**
- integrates well with Prometheus
- supports a wide range of metric types
- (relatively) easy to use by writing PromQL queries
- supports alerts (e.g. email)

## Logging
- **ELFK stack - Filebeat + Logstash + Elasticsearch + Kibana**
  - very popular, pretty much industry standard
  - nice interoperability (Kibana is tailored for Elasticsearch)
  - Logstash + Elasticsearch can be very resource-heavy -> Filebeat addresses this with lightweight log collection
- **Grafana + Loki**
  - less resource-heavy
  - could integrate well into our existing Grafana service
  - less popular choice

We chose the ELFK stack mainly because it's the most popular choice, and we wanted to get familiar with it.
